# Countdown_Timer
A countdown timer built using Python's Tkinter library
The timer allows users to set a countdown in hours, minutes, and seconds. When the timer reaches zero, a beep is triggered. 
The GUI is user-friendly, and the timer can be controlled with start, pause, and reset buttons.
Future improvements: (i) Add sound notifications when the countdown finishes 
(ii)Custom music can be added during the countdown
(iii)Implement custom themes for the UI
